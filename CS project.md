**CS PROJECT**

**CRITERION A: PLANNING**

**Problem definition**

The owner of the local game shop is an enthusiast of classic computer games. He has been looking for a talented programmer that can help him revive his passion for text-based games. He has few requirements for this task:

- The game has to be entirely text-based.
- The game must record the time played.
- The game must record the playerâ€™s name and score.

Apart from these requirements, the owner is open to any type of game, topic, or genre.


**Proposed solution**

The project I am going to make will be an only text-based program and will look like an escape room game. This game is designed to be played mainly by gamers, but it is easy, friendly, and accessible. Therefore, it can be played by everyone who is willing to play a mini mysterious escape room game for entertainment. So, this game will be made in PyCharm 2021.2 and is constructed using the software Python 3. I chose to use this software since it is popular, friendly to use software, and at the same time has powerful tools. It will take me about 3 weeks to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria:

- The program will give some options to the user like A, B, C or Yes and No, in order to take quick and efficient decisions.
- There will be a time limit, and according to the time spent and the efficiency of the decisions, there will be created a score of the player.
